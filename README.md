# Finance
i have first installed all prerequisite dependencies
and basically used pandas, matplotlib and yfinance for this assignment.
stock i have chosen is INFOSYS.
i have taken the period of three months equal to 66 days as those are the number of weekdays during any such period (on an average count).
finding sma and ema was new to me and took me much time to research on how to do it as i was faced with quite a few errors due to my incorrect approach at first.
overall it was quite fun experience.
