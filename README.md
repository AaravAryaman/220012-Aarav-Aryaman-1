# Finance
Assignment-1  
i have first installed all prerequisite dependencies
and basically used pandas, matplotlib and yfinance for this assignment.
stock i have chosen is INFOSYS.
i have taken the period of three months equal to 66 days as those are the number of weekdays during any such period (on an average count).
finding sma and ema was new to me and took me much time to research on how to do it as i was faced with quite a few errors due to my incorrect approach at first.
overall it was quite fun experience.  
  
Assignment-2  
Team Members- Aarav Aryaman 220012 & Jiyanshu Dhaka 220481  
The objective of this assignment was to develop a trading strategy using Kernel Channel and Stochastic Oscillator for both small cap (J K Lakshmi Cement) and large cap (Infosys) stocks.  
I, Aarav took up the major coding part and assigned Jiyanshu the major report/analysis part by mutual agreement to manage time.  
We were both active in the other aspect as well, Jiyanshu suggesting improvements in the code implementations and me, suggesting changes in the report to make it more well-versed and informative.
We applied formulae, plotted signals, calculated metrics (backtested using historical data), and analysed the overall and individual trading strategies.
